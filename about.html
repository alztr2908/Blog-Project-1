      <h1 class='articleTitle'>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life.</h1>
      <p><span class='mod'>I used to be a pack rat.</span> I  had so many things that I though that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it becasue there was too much.</p>
      <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'>How I turned things around</p>
      <p><span class='mod'>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</span>. I leterally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartmen, and I quit my job.</p>
      <p> It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad placce, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
      <p class='subtitle'>Now I live a simple life</p>
      <p>Now that I'm a living a simple life, things are so much better. I;m less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy</p>
      <p>With how much it turned my life around, <span class='mod'>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</span>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
